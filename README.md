# PHP Products Cart
 Basic products cart in PHP and JQuery.

Cart.php class handles cart information including setting the 
products array into HTML and calculating quantities.

- Allows user to create new products
- Change the quantity of products
- Remove products
- Uses PHP sessions to save data

Alternative approach could be to add MySQL for saving beyond PHP sessions.
